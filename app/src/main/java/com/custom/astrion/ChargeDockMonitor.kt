/**
 * Detects whether [activity] is sitting on its charging dock — as opposed
 * to just being plugged into a computer over USB for development, which
 * reports charging identically (both read as generic "AC" via
 * [BatteryManager], confirmed on real hardware; the dock's two charging
 * pins carry power only, bypassing the USB data lines entirely). What
 * *does* differ: whether a USB *data* connection is present at all — a
 * real cable enumerates, the dock's power-only pins never do. So: charging
 * AND no USB data connection = genuinely docked.
 *
 * While docked, also owns the charging screen's auto-dim timer: window
 * brightness down to near-zero after [DIM_DELAY_MS] of no touches (see
 * [onUserInteraction], meant to be called from the Activity's own
 * override of the same name — the standard Android hook for "the user is
 * still there" regardless of which view or Compose node actually
 * consumed the touch), back up immediately on the next one.
 *
 * Extracted out of MainActivity — which was starting to accumulate a lot
 * of unrelated concerns in one place — so this one feature's state,
 * receiver, and timer live somewhere they can be read start to finish.
